    <h2>Students Activities</h2>
    <h5>Bharatiyam 2015: Nurturing Attitudes and Aptitudes of Engineers</h5>
    <p>Bharati Vidyapeeth University College of Engineering had organized its 26th annual National Level technical festival, BHARATIYAM-2015 with great zeal and enthusiasm on 20th and 21st February 2015.</p>

        <p>The chief guest for inaugural function of Bharatiyam 2015 was Prof. D. N. Reddy who is member of University Grants Commission, Govt. of India, New Delhi also Chairman of Appellate committee for National Board of Accreditation, MHRD, Govt. of. India, and Chairman of Recruitment and Assessment Committee of DRDO, under Ministry of Defense.
        
        The Guest of honor for inaugural was Mr. Shrirang Bapat, President, Uniken, Pune. The inaugural function was held on 20th February 2015, at 10:00 am, at Bharati Vidyapeeth University College of Engineering, Dhankawadi, Pune.</p>

        
    <p>In his speech Dr. D. N. Reddy focused on 12 attributes which all engineering graduates must possess so that they can contribute not only to their own prosperity but also to the enrichment and upliftment of society. The 12 attributes which he mentioned were thorough engineering knowledge, analytical and problem solving skills, ability to design and develop solutions, investigative skills, modern tool usage, social scientist, sustainability, values and ethics, individual and team work, communication, project management and financial accounting, lifelong learning. If any engineer introspects and works with these attributes success will follow him like his tail. Engineers should also possess soft skills and should be able to apply their concepts in problem solving. He further said that India spends only 1% of GDP for Research and development whereas smaller countries like Israel spend 4.8% of their GDP on same. To improve contribution of research towards society it must be made mandatory that outcome of Ph. D. should be applied to society. He also said that Indian engineers are liked all the world since they can work anywhere. But unfortunately Indians work well outside India but due to lack of discipline they do not contribute in India. Whatever is invented must be transferred to technology and then production and manufacture. Many a times it is said that GDP does not matter to common man but Prof. Reddy explained that 1 million jobs are created for a common man when the GDP raises even by 1%. Industry earns profits and contributes to prosperity of nation. Educational institutes impart knowledge and creativity. An alliance of these both will definitely flourish the nation. He also said that although India has highly qualifies population but its skill base is only 20% whereas 80% in countries like Singapore, Malaysia, Korea etc. To stress and importance of skill base he gave example of Korea which is country smaller than Maharashtra but owns more than 10 chip foundries whereas India has none. Out of 132 countries, India ranks 47th for its innovative potential. A strong engineering backbone can only bring this ranking to a single digit figure and truly lead the country towards development. He concluded his speech saying that it is possible for students to enjoy only when they are in institutes but they should use this time not only for enjoying but also to learn, excel in knowledge and develop their creativity and that Bharatiyam is a perfect platform for it
        
        Prof. Dr. Anand Bhalerao, Principal BVUCOE, and Chairman of Bharatiyam 2015, presented his introductory speech in which he informed about the glorious tradition of Bharati Vidyapeeth University and the various noteworthy rankings and accreditations credited to University and BVUCOE for its quality education. He said that we all dream to see India as a superpower but in the resent scenario we need to change our mindset. India has potential and talent but not the desired drive to achieve it. An approach with penchant and focus on innovation and research can change the scenario. And it is techfest like Bharatiyam which inculcates such approach in students
        
        On this occasion Guest of Honour, Mr. Shrirang Bapat, President Uniken, Pune, shares three top tips which helped him to scale personal life and competence and will also definitely help students. He said that ability to express ideas, a drive to identify and solve burning problems, and a trustworthy mentor are the key to successful entrepreneur. Explaining it he said that having ideas alone isn’t enough, ability to express and convert these ideas is also equally important otherwise it just makes us silent operators. We should be keen to identify and work for burning problems. It has always been people who take these burning problems head on have made it big. He also said that having these abilities, a mentor on whom you trust unquestionably is extremely important to guide us through the course of success
        
        “Genre”, the annual magazine of BVUCOE was also inaugurated by the hands of Chief Guest on this occasion. Newsletter “Zero day”, which is a newsletter for the Network security course run by joint collaboration of IQSPL and BVUCOE was also inaugurated by Guest of Honor.</p>
        
       <p> For the past 26 years, all disciplinary Departments of the college have been organizing a variety of events involving both students and faculty members alike. Around 3000+ students from over 107 colleges all over the nation have registered for various events of Bharatiyam 2015</p>

   <h2>Entrepreneurship Development Cell</h2>
   <p>In line with the mission of our Organizations is “Social Transformation Through Dynamic Education”, the ED – Cell of Bharati Vidyapeeth (Deemed to be University) College of Engineering Pune is one the most Innovative entrepreneurship development cell across the region. Entrepreneurship Development Cell (EDC) is a nonprofit constituent of the institute that advances lasting solutions to improve education, promote entrepreneurs, expand economic opportunities and motivate the students to be entrepreneurs.</p>
    <p>As said by Our Dynamic Principal Hon. Dr. Anand Bhalerao Sir “Not giving jobs, but creating entrepreneurs is the job of an Engineering college” and under his guidance The ED – Cell was established on 27th September 2013.</p>
    <p>To an economist, an entrepreneur is one who brings resources, labour, materials, and other assets into combinations that make their value greater than before, and also one who introduces changes, innovations, and a new order. To a psychologist, such a person is typically driven by certain forces; the need to obtain or attain something, to experiment, to accomplish, or perhaps to escape the authority of others. To one businessman, an entrepreneur appears as a threat, an aggressive competitor, whereas to another businessman the same entrepreneur may be an ally, a source of supply, a customer, or someone who creates wealth for others, as well as finds better ways to utilize resources, reduce waste, and produce jobs others are glad to get.</p>
